# LeToR-Problem-using-Linear-Regression
One of the reasons why Search Engines today are the go-to place to find information is because of Search Engine Optimization. Any person searching on the internet would like their search results to be as accurate as possible. In order to make future searches possible, we can use Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Gradient Descent to enhance the Search Engine Optimization process. In this project, our goal is to use the concepts of Linear Regression and Gradient Decent algorithms to solve the problem of Learning to Rank in Information Retrieval on Microsoft’s LeToR Dataset. 

## Overview

Search Engine Optimization also abbreviated as SEO can be described as a process optimizing the results provided by a search algorithm in such a way that most relevant & frequent results are shown with greater importance.
Imagine that you have developed a website that provides great information about how to use farming tools. Hence you would like your website to be displayed prominently in the search results whenever someone searches for ‘farming tools’. In order to make such a task of selecting a website or link from multiple links, we use the concept of ranking. 
In this project, we use the concept of Learning to Rank (LeToR) or Machine-Learned Ranking(MLR), wherein we follow two approaches of implementing linear regression to rank links and web pages according to some predefined features.
